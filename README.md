## Occupancy rates of Truck parking spaces.
Task is to determine the occupancy rates of the truck parking areas to see whether the parking area would be full at a certain time of day or not.
The dataset that contains a list of floating car data (FCD) collected in one day. There are 5 attributes for the dataset:
1. Truck_id: identifies the truck anonymously
2. Speed: speed of the truck when the record was collected in km/s
3. Tracked_at: the timestamp of when the record was collected
4. Latitude: Latitude coordinates of where the truck when collecting the data
5. Longitude: Longitude coordinates of where the truck when collecting the data

## TASKS:
1. Data Exploration and Machine Learning:
Explore data to understand context and extract key information.
Start with basic statistics, data visualization, and feature analysis.
Select suitable machine learning techniques.

2. Factors Affecting Occupancy Rates:
Identify factors influencing occupancy rates in truck parking areas.
Consider variables like location, time of day, weather, and truck size.
Analyze historical data for correlations and trends.

3. Estimating Occupancy Rates:
Estimate occupancy rates in parking areas using data and models.
